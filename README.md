# SubQuery - DyDx POC

**This SubQuery project indexes all transfer events and messages on dYdX**

## Start

First, install SubQuery CLI globally on your terminal by using NPM `npm install -g @subql/cli`

Clone this GitHub repository.

Don't forget to install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`!

## Run

The simplest way to run this project is by running `yarn dev` or `npm run-script dev`. This does all the following:

1.  `yarn codegen` - Generates types from the GraphQL schema definition and contract ABIs and saves them in the `/src/types` directory. This must be done after each change to the `schema.graphql` file or the contract ABIs
2.  `yarn build` - Builds and packages the SubQuery project into the `/dist` directory
3.  `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up` - Runs a Docker container with an indexer, PostgeSQL DB, and a query service. This requires [Docker to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and running locally. The configuration for this container is set from your `docker-compose.yml`

You can observe the three services start, and once all are running (it may take a few minutes on your first start), please open your browser and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - you should see a GraphQL playground showing with the schemas ready to query. [Read the docs for more information](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) or [explore the possible service configuration for running SubQuery](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/references.html).

## Query your project

For this project, you can try to query with the following GraphQL code to get a taste of how it works.

```graphql
{
  query {
    transferEvents(first: 5) {
      nodes {
        id
        blockHeight
        txHash
        recipient
        sender
        amount
      }
    }
    messages(first: 5) {
      nodes {
        id
        blockHeight
        txHash
        from
        to
        amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can explore the different possible queries and entities to help you with GraphQL using the documentation draw on the right.

## Publish your project

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), [view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html)
- By publishing it to our enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network), where we'll host your SubQuery project in production ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. We even have a generous free tier. [Find out how](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html)
- [Coming Soon] By publishing it to the decentralised [SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way
